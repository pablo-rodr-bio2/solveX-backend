# 'Solve the X' assignment

This is the developed backend for the 'Solve the X' assignment.

Ive used the next tecnologies:
- TypeScript (lang)
- Express (backend)
- Sqlite3 (db)
- Sequelize (ORM)

Since I didn't have much experience apart from some tutorials, I've used the next documentation in order to produce this stack:

- [Express Official Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)
- [How to set up TypeScript with Node.js and Express](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-set-up-node-typescript-express/)
- [Build a bullet proof REST API with Typescript, Express.js and Sequelize with Sqlite3 |CRUD REST API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFgrSJGNj0E&list=LL&index=5&t=3s)

## How to use

Clone this repository in your local system. It contains both the backend and the used database.
Then run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
